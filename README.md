# Prosper Loan Data
## by Jonathan Ravel


## Dataset

The Prosper Loan Dataset contains a wide variety of information pertaining to Prosper's main product of personal loans; information is from 2005 to 2014.

With 81 fields a full exploration was beyond the scope of this project, but I focused on selected areas of interest: Prosper's growth from 2010 to 2013, and the rates that were being paid by the borrowers of the loans.

For Prosper's year over year growth, 2005 and 2014 were removed as partial years.

For an analysis of loan term on interest rates, the 12 month terms were removed as an outlier.

## Summary of Findings

Prosper grew very rapidly from 2010 to 2013. Total loan listings grew at a rapid pace, from just over 5000 in 2010 up to nearly 35000 in 2013. The sizes of the loans increased as well, with the median loan more than doubling in this period from 5000 to 10000.

The rates borrowers paid varied greatly - the best rated borrowers paid under 10%, while the worst borrowers paid over 35%. An examination of the correlation between typical factors such as Credit Score and Debt to Income Ratio showed fairly low correlations to the Prosper Score and Borrower APR. This means Prosper was using other information to underwrite these borrowers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Prosper grew rapidly from 2010 to 2013, with many borrowers paying for their signature personal loan product. The rates borrowers paid varied greatly, and did not appear to be strongly correlated with a traditional credit score. This means Prosper was using other data to underwrite these borrowers.
